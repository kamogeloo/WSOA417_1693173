        text: 'In this article, Thorlacius states that she uses the concept aesthetics to refer to visual, sound and interactive means of effect; she argues that there is always visual communication in websites, that every element that is included and displayed in the interface of a website communicates something to the user (Thorlacius, 2007, pg.63). The colors, the type of typography that a designer uses, and even the placement of elements on a website, communicate something to the user; and it is for this reason that Thorlacius (2007) argues that it important for designer to have knowledge about visual communication. She argues that visual symbols are part our daily lives and that is why it is important for web designers to have knowledge of graphic effects and visual symbols (and semiotics) is crucial for designers, for the communication to the users to be intentional (Thorlacius, 2007, pg.63).'

        text: 'In this artwork I see chaos, there are too many elements added, some in 2D and some in 3D, texts are overlapping on top of other texts, challenging the readability and the access to information. The artist used the colors neon pink and neon cyan for some texts that are overlapping, and according to a website called approval studio, those colors do not go together, because they are referred to as disturbing and reckless, having multiple neon colors will have them fighting for the userâ€™s attention. Another color according to the article that does not go with neon pink is green, which is also present in the artwork.'

        text: 'My aim with this website was to make it functional, make sure all the links and all the elements worked, I also wanted it to be very simple, not too complex. I went straight ahead and started building the website without a plan, and without wireframes. I then realized that I was having a difficult time trying to figure out the layout of my website, and only then I began wireframing for a few of my web sections.'

        text: 'In this article I will be discussing a paper written by Ji Yong Park titled Design Principles for Interactive User Experience Through Net Art. This article claims to define user interface principles through user experiences in net art that will allow the designer to achieve user-centered design. Before we get into discussing the principles, I will first explore the concept of net art, to find out what it is and what can and cannot be considered as net art.'

        text: 'Browser Pong is an internet game that was developed by Stewart Smith and published in 2010. It is an experimental project that was made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and I believe it qualifies as internet art, Ji Yong Park would agree too. Park, in an article that he wrote titled <i> Design principles for interactive user experience through net art</i>, argued that net artists need to experiment with the invisible elements and that is exactly what Smith did.'
